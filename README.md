- Terminal:

`@ ./dbdrop.sql`

`@ ./dbinsert.sql`

2. Change your login and password for Oracle Database in UniversityBookshop.java:

```
public boolean loginDB() {
		String username = "yourUSERNAME";// Replace to your username
		String password = "yourPASSWORD";// Replace to your password
		...
		}
```

   - No books in the order are out of stock.
   - The student does not have any outstanding orders (all books ordered earlier had been delivered).

   - If payment method is credit card, credit card no is required.

5. üóëÔ∏è Cancel an Order: This option allows the manager to cancel an existing order, provided that no books from the order have been delivered.

   A student can cancel an order if the following conditions are met:

   - None of the books in the order has been delivered.
   - The order was made in the recent 7 days.

6. üìö Show All Books: This option displays a list of all available books in the inventory.
